Static Comp Challenge 2

# Static Comp Challenge 2

This project was submitted for Module 1 by Dina Caraballo. 

# Assignment Instructions
The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

## Creative License
You may NOT take liberties with the layout, but your creative license includes:
* Copy
* Images
* Icons
* Color palette, but ONLY if you select a complementary palette. We highly encourage you to visit sites like: material palette or coolors or color-hex.

## Base Requirements
* Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css
* Site must be responsive
* Create a repo on github :octocat: for your work with following naming construct: [initials]-comp-challenge-[challenge number] `(i.e. “bt-comp-challenge-1”)`
* Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.
* Push your final work to github pages
